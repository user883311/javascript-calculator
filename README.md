# Javascript Calculator

User Story: I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
User Story: I can clear the input field with a clear button.
User Story: I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.

My implementation is built using vanilla JS and a good amount of Regexp.
